# Euclidean and Manhattan Distance Case Study

## Overview
This project explores the differences between **Euclidean** and **Manhattan** distance metrics using a numerical dataset. These distance measures play a crucial role in data science, underpinning algorithms such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and clustering techniques.

Through visual comparisons and histograms, this case study helps illustrate how these distances vary in two-dimensional space.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this study consists of numerical coordinates representing points in a **YZ plane**. The distances are computed with respect to reference points to highlight differences between the two distance measures.

## Methodology
- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points.
- **Manhattan Distance**: Measures the distance traveled along axes (grid-like movement).

### Steps:
1. Compute **Euclidean** and **Manhattan** distances from reference points.
2. Generate **scatter plots** to visualize the distances.
3. Create **histograms** to analyze the distribution of both distance metrics.

## Visualizations
The notebook generates:
- **Scatter plots** of distances color-coded by metric.
- **Histograms** comparing the distributions of Euclidean and Manhattan distances.
